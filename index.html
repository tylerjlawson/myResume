  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  
  
    <ul>
      
        <li>I have a 10 month old portuguese water dog named Gus, so he and I have fun walking while I am taking a break from work. You can see a picture of him <a href="https://tyler-lawson.com">here</a> (pro tip: there is a different picture shown as the background for the mobile sized breakpoint).</li>
      
        <li>Growing up, I was unable to ever experience fresh bakery goods due to the potential cross contamination with nuts. After trying fresh baked bread from a friend&rsquo;s dutch oven in the winter of 2019, bread baking and pizza making has become a new hobby and passion for me.</li>
      
        <li>I have skied since I was 3 years old. It&rsquo;s nice when the east coast weather graces us with snow on top of the perpetual ice.</li>
