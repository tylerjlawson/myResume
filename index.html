  <h2>Work With Static Site Generators</h2>
  
  
    <ul>
      
        <li>I have done most of my side projects over the past 4 years with static site generators.</li>
      
        <li>I have made 3 Hugo themes and 7 sites using Hugo. <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/simple-resume/">See this resume as a theme here!</a>. You can also view this resume as a webpage <a href="https://tyler-lawson.com/resume">here</a>. You can see my portfolio, where I showcase most of the sites I have made <a href="https://tyler-lawson.com/#portfolio">here</a>.</li>
      
        <li>I started with using Jekyll to make <a href="https://thepulpit.github.io">my friend&rsquo;s first blog</a>.</li>
      
        <li>The next framework I tried was a lightweight framework from Mozilla called <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>. I used this to make <a href="https://visitingdentalhygiene.com">my mother&rsquo;s small business site</a>.</li>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  
  
    <ul>
      
        <li>I made a python script for re-naming and re-dating image files for family photos. They are now all on Google Photos for my Mom, Grandma, and myself to view at any time!</li>
      
        <li>A friend of mine who is a patent lawyer needs to screenshot every single page of a website for legal reasons. After hearing that he did this manually, I wrote a python script for him to automate the process.</li>
      
        <li>I wrote a personal repository to store my favorite configurations/dotfiles <a href="https://github.com/tylerjlawson/dotfiles">here</a>. My gitconfig is my pride and joy.</li>
      
        <li>I wrote a medium article/tutorial about my favorite tech stack for small static sites: <a href="https://medium.com/@tylerjlawson2/best-tech-stack-for-small-static-sites-7b6e64eff3c1">click here to see the article</a></li>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  
  
    <ul>
      
        <li>I have a 10 month old portuguese water dog named Gus, so he and I have fun walking while I am taking a break from work. You can see a picture of him <a href="https://tyler-lawson.com">here</a> (pro tip: there is a different picture shown as the background for the mobile sized breakpoint).</li>
      
        <li>Growing up, I was unable to ever experience fresh bakery goods due to the potential cross contamination with nuts. After trying fresh baked bread from a friend&rsquo;s dutch oven in the winter of 2019, bread baking and pizza making has become a new hobby and passion for me.</li>
      
        <li>I have skied since I was 3 years old. It&rsquo;s nice when the east coast weather graces us with snow on top of the perpetual ice.</li>
