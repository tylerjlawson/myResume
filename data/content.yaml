            I have been a core developer on the team responsible for creating [authorbyhumana.com]
            (https://authorbyhumana.com) and our member dashboard,
            [my.authorbyhumana.com](https://my.authorbyhumana.com).
            [Author](https://www.businessinsider.com/humana-launches-author-to-compete-with-buzzy-insurance-startups-2021-1)
            is a new brand from Humana, designed to reinvent medicare advantage care. (React/Typescript)

            Developed the largest share of features on the team to ensure a successful launch on
            January 1st.
          - >-
            I have iteratively enhanced the team's jest tests with utility functions to
            prevent pipeline timeouts and update fixes, as I have kept each of our node packages
            up to date since last summer.
          - >-
            I am mentoring other developers on the team, including senior engineers, with our
            frontend technologies and CI/CD. This has included developing an automatic deployment
            flow through Gitlab (saves 30 minutes dev time per day) and Microsoft Teams notifications to alert the team when a scheduled Cypress end-to-end test fails.

            Lead a team of interns in developing a CRUD app for Humana architects to
            collaborate on project estimations. This saved the architects
            an average of one hour per day and reduced the chance for error. It replaced
            their process of building estimations through email-chained excel spreadsheets.
          - >-
            With my second team at Humana, I refactored and enhanced
            a Vue/.Net dashboard that serves as a real-time incident report tracker.

        A friend of mine who is a patent lawyer needs to screenshot every single page of a website for legal reasons. After hearing that he did this manually, I wrote [a python script](https://github.com/tylerjlawson/screenshotter) for him to automate the process.
