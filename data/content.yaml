            The only web experience I had prior to this job was by using a GoDaddy
            website builder. I learned how to build sites using simple CSS/HTML and then
            found a new interest in static site generators, like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
            and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
          - >-
            Learned the importance of caring for CSS and and reusable components before

        the elephants in South Africa could hopefully one day be tracked without obstructive and expensive tracking equipment.

        I have a 10 month old portuguese water dog named Gus, so he and I have fun walking while I am taking a break from work. You can see a picture of him [here](https://tyler-lawson.com) (pro tip: there is a different picture shown as the background for the mobile sized breakpoint).

        Growing up, I was unable to ever experience fresh bakery goods due to the potential cross contamination with nuts. After trying fresh baked bread from a friend's dutch oven in the winter of 2019, bread baking and pizza making has become a new hobby and passion for me.

        I have skied since I was 3 years old. It is especially nice when the east coast weather graces us with snow on top of the perpetual ice.
